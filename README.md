# Memory-Game
A simple game of memory, implemented using HTML5, CSS3 and Vanilla Javascript.

## Objective:
You are presented a 4x4 grid of squares. Some squares are red, while the rest are blue. When the game starts, you will see the location of the red and blue squares. One second later, the squares will turn white. You must correctly select the red squares without selecting any of the blue squares. If you do so, you win. Otherwise, you lose.

The location of the red squares are shuffled at the start of a new game. Have fun.
